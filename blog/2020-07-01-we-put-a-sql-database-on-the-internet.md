  What happens when you put a SQL database on the internet? Demo launch on
  HackerNews postmortem.

What happens when you put a SQL database on the internet? It's probably not what
you'd expect.

But we did it. And then we posted it to Hacker News.

<!-- truncate -->

If you listen to, well, pretty much anyone rational, they will tell you in no
uncertain terms that the last thing you ever want to do is put your SQL Database
on the internet. And even if you're crazy enough to do that, you certainly would
never go post the address to it on a place like Hacker News. Not unless you were
a masochist anyway.

We did it though, and we're not even a little bit sorry about it.

## The idea

QuestDB has built what we think is the fastest Open Source SQL Database in
existence. We really do. And we're pretty proud of it, in fact. So much so that
we wanted to give anyone that wanted the opportunity a chance to take it for a
spin. With real data. Doing real queries. Almost anyone can pull together a demo
that performs great under just the right conditions, with all the parameters
tightly controlled.

But what happens if you unleash the hordes on it? What happens if you let anyone
run queries against it? Well, we can tell you, now.

## What it is

First off, it's a SQL-based Time Series database, built from the ground up for
performance. It's built to store and query very large amounts of data very
quickly.

We deployed it on an AWS `c5.metal` server in the London, UK datacenter (sorry
all you North Americans, there's some built-in latency due to the laws of
physics). It was configured with 196GB of RAM, but we were only using 40GB at
peak usage. The `c5.metal` instance provides 2 24-core CPUs (48 cores), but we
only used one of them (24 cores) on 23 threads. We really weren't using anywhere
_close_ to the full potential of this AWS instance. That didn't appear to matter
at all.

The data is stored on an AWS EBS volume that provides SSD access to the data.
It's not all in memory.

The data is the entire
[NYC Taxi Database](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
plus associated weather data. It amounts to 1.6 billion records, weighing in at
about 350GB of data. That's a lot. And it's too much to store in-memory. It's
too much to cache.

We provided some clickable queries to get people started (none of the results
were cached or pre-calculated) but we essentially didn't restrict the kinds of
queries that users could run. We wanted to see, and let users see, how well this
performed on whatever queries they threw at it.

It was not disappointing!

And then we posted the link to the live database.

And sat back.

And watched the incoming traffic.

And tried not to panic.

## What happened

First off, we made the front page of Hacker News. Then we stayed there. For
hours.

We saw a lot of traffic. I mean a lot of traffic. Somewhere over 20,000 unique
IP addresses.

Excluding simple show queries, we saw 17,128 SQL queries with 2,485 syntax
errors in the queries. We sent back almost 40GB of data in response to the
queries. The response times were phenomenal. Sub-second responses to nearly all
of the queries.

Someone in the HN comments suggested that column stores are bad at joins, which
led to someone coming in and trying to join the table to itself. Ordinarily,
this would be a stunningly bad decision.

The result was ... not what they were expecting:

![query results showing unholy number of results](/img/blog/2020-07-01/join.png)

Yeah, that's 2,671,914,914,060,072,000 rows. In 69ms (including network transfer
time). That's a lot of results in a very short amount of time. Definitely not
what they were expecting.

We saw only a couple of bad actors try something cute:

```log
2020-06-23T20:59:02.958813Z I i.q.c.h.p.JsonQueryProcessorState [8536] exec [q='drop table trips'] 2020-06-24T02:56:55.782072Z I i.q.c.h.p.JsonQueryProcessorState [6318] exec [q='drop *']
```

But those didn't work. We may be crazy, but we're not naive.

## What we learned

It turns out that when you do something like this, you learn a lot. You learn
about your strengths and your weaknesses. And you learn about what users want to
do with your product as well as what they will do to try to break it.

Joining the table to itself was one such lesson. But we also saw a lot of folks
use a `where` clause, which caused fairly slow results. We were not entirely
surprised by this result, as we are aware that we have not done the
optimizations on that path to yield the fast results we want. But it was a great
insight into how often it is used, and how people use it.

We saw a number of people use the `group by` clause as well, and then be
surprised that it didn't work. We probably should have warned people about that.
In short, `group by` is automatically inferred, so it's not needed. But since
it's not implemented at all, it causes an error. So we're looking at ways to
handle that.

We are taking all these lessons to heart, and making plans to address everything
we saw in upcoming releases.

## Conclusions

It seems that the vast majority of the people that tried the demo were very
impressed with it. The speed is truly breathtaking.

Here are just a few of the comments we got in the thread:

> I abused LEFT JOIN to create a query that produces 224,964,999,650,251 rows.
> Only 3.68ms execution time, now that's impressive!

> Very cool. Major props for putting this out there and accepting arbitrary
> queries.

> Very impressive, i think building your own (performant) database from scratch
> is one of the most impressive software engineering feats.

> Very cool and impressive!! Is full PostreSQL wire compatibility on the
> roadmap? I like postgres compatibility :)

(Yes, full Postgres wire protocol is on the roadmap!)

> Mind blowing, did not know about questDB. The back button seems broken on
> chrome mobile

Yes, the demo did break the Back button on your browser. There's an actual
reason for that, but it is true, for now. We're definitely addressing that one
right away.
