We've been upping our SWAG game a lot lately, and we want to share it with you,
the valuable members of our community! We want to give you the chance to show
off your projects, show off your love for QuestDB, and to show just off!

<!-- truncate -->

## How does it work?

It's going to be really simple. And there are different levels of SWAG and
participation. Just complete a level, get the SWAG.

### Level 1: You're new here

Why don't you like us more? It's ok, give us some time, you'll come to ‚ù§Ô∏è us!
But we're fine if you want to start off slow. For this level, we'll send you
some of our cool QuestDB stickers. Yeah, just stickers, but you haven't been
able to go to any conferences in _months_ so we know your supply is running low.

The easiest level:

- [Follow](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=QuestDB) us on Twitter
  -- Don't forget to send us a tweet so we know you're there!.
- [Join]({@slackUrl@}) our Slack community
- Send us your address (because how else are we going to send them?)

### Level 2: You're cool, but just really busy

So you like QuestDB. But you're not sure you _like_ like QuestDB. Fair enough.
We get it. But you still want some SWAG and to show the world that you like
QuestDB. We'll send you a _really_ nice hard-enamel, full-color QuestDB pin
along with the Level 1 stickers.

This level's pretty easy to get. Just do the following:

- [üåü](https://github.com/questdb/questdb) on GitHub
- [Follow](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=QuestDB) us on Twitter
- Send out a tweet about how much you like QuestDB -- and that you gave us a üåü
  on GitHub! (Don't forget to @QuestDB so we can see it!)
- [Join]({@slackUrl@}) our Slack community
- Send us your mailing address!

### Level 3: QuestDB Early Adopter

You're a QuestDB Superfan and you want everyone to know it! At this level you
will get one of our exclusive, _really_ nice custom-embroidered T-Shirts. These
are not your standard printed tech T-Shirts. No, these are heavy-weight (6oz)
cotton-blend shirts with the QuestDB logo _embroidered_ in full color on the
left chest. You won't be waxing your car with this shirt! You'll also get the
pin and the stickers, of course, because you're a super-fan!

At this level we assume you already
[follow](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=QuestDB) us and are a
member of our [community]({@slackUrl@}), but if not, please do!

How do you get this level? Just do the following:

- Build a project -- any project really -- using QuestDB. Do something cool with
  it.
- Write up a blog post about it. You can post it on your blog, or on Medium, or
  Dev.to or wherever you want. If you don't have a place to post it, or you'd
  rather be featured on _our_ blog then just send it to us and we'll post it!
- Send us your mailing address (we'll need a phone number too, probably, as most
  shippers require one now)
  - Bonus: Send out a tweet of you wearing your QuestDB shirt. Don't forget to
    [@QuestDB](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=QuestDB) so we
    don't miss it!

  style={{
    display: "block",
    maxHeight: "400px",
    margin: "0 auto",
    marginBottom: "2rem",
  }}
/>

That's it! Sit back and wait for the SWAG!

### Level 4: QuestDB Implementor Extraordinaire!

You think QuestDB is the solution to all your data woes. You don't just think
it, you _know_ it! So much so that you've already implemented a solution, in
production, at your company.

We love you! Reach out and let's talk. We'll have some _really_ special SWAG for
you. You're going to like it, we promise.
