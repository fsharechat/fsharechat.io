  A short tutorial that will show you how to interact with time series data.
---

The goal of this tutorial is to explore QuestDB's features to interact with time
series data. This assumes you have an instance running. You can find guides to
setup QuestDB on the [introduction page](/docs/introduction/).

In this tutorial, you will learn how to

- [Create tables](#creating-a-table)
- [Populate tables with sample data](#inserting-data)
- [Run simple and advanced queries](#running-queries)
- [Delete tables](#deleting-tables)

As an example, we will look at hypothetical temperature readings from a variety
of sensors.

:::info

All commands are run through the [Web Console](/docs/guide/web-console/)
accessible on http://localhost:9000.

You can also run the same SQL using [Postgres wire](/docs/guide/postgres-wire/)
or the [REST API](/docs/guide/rest/).

## Creating a table

The first step is to create tables. One will contain the metadata of our
sensors, the other will contain the readings from these sensors.

Let's start by creating the `sensors` table.

```questdb-sql title="Create a table"
CREATE TABLE sensors (ID LONG, make STRING, city STRING);
```

:::info

The `CREATE TABLE` command comes with many more functions. For more information,
please refer to the [CREATE TABLE](/docs/reference/sql/create-table/) command
reference.

:::

## Inserting data

Let's populate our `sensors` table with procedurally-generated data.

```questdb-sql title="Insert as select"
INSERT INTO sensors
    SELECT
        x ID, --increasing integer
        rnd_str('Eberle', 'Honeywell', 'Omron', 'United Automation', 'RS Pro') make,
        rnd_str('New York', 'Miami', 'Boston', 'Chicago', 'San Francisco') city
    FROM long_sequence(10000) x
;
```

:::info

For more information on `INSERT` and `INSERT as select`, please refer to the
[INSERT reference](/docs/reference/sql/insert/).

For more information on procedurally generated data in the
[random generator functions](/docs/reference/function/random-value-generator/)
and in the [row generator functions](/docs/reference/function/row-generator/).

:::

Our `sensors` table now contains 10,000 randomly generated sensors of different
makes and in various cities. It should look like the below:

| ID  | make              | city     |
| --- | ----------------- | -------- |
| 1   | RS Pro            | New York |
| 2   | Honeywell         | Chicago  |
| 3   | United Automation | Miami    |
| 4   | Honeywell         | Chicago  |
| ... | ...               | ...      |

Let's now create some sensor readings. In this case, we will generate the table
and the data at the same time.

```questdb-sql title="Create table as"
CREATE TABLE readings
AS(
    SELECT
        x ID,
        timestamp_sequence(to_timestamp('2019-10-17T00:00:00', 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss'), rnd_long(1,10,2) * 100000L) ts,
        rnd_double(0)*8 + 15 temp,
        rnd_long(0, 10000, 0) sensorId
    FROM long_sequence(10000000) x)
TIMESTAMP(ts)
PARTITION BY MONTH;
```

:::note

While creating this table we did the following:

- `TIMESTAMP(ts)` elected `ts` as
  [designated timestamp](/docs/concept/designated-timestamp/). This will enable
  time partitioning.
- `PARTITION BY MONTH` created a monthly partition strategy. Our data will be
  sharded in monthly files.

:::

The generated data will look like the below.

| ID  | ts                          | temp        | sensorId |
| --- | --------------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 1   | 2019-10-17T00:00:00.000000Z | 19.37373911 | 9160     |
| 2   | 2019-10-17T00:00:00.600000Z | 21.91184617 | 9671     |
| 3   | 2019-10-17T00:00:01.400000Z | 16.58367834 | 8731     |
| 4   | 2019-10-17T00:00:01.500000Z | 16.69308815 | 3447     |
| 5   | 2019-10-17T00:00:01.600000Z | 19.67991569 | 7985     |
| ... | ...                         | ...         | ...      |

## Running queries

Let's first select all records from the `readings` table (note the omission of
`SELECT * FROM`):

```questdb-sql title="Select *"
readings;
```

Let's also select the `count` of records from `readings`:

```questdb-sql title="Simple aggregation"
SELECT count() FROM readings;
```

| count      |
| ---------- |
| 10,000,000 |

and the average reading:

```questdb-sql title="Simple aggregation"
SELECT avg(temp) FROM readings;
```

| average |
| ------- |
| 18.997  |

We can now leverage our `sensors` table to get more interesting data.

```questdb-sql title="Simple JOIN"
SELECT *
FROM readings
JOIN(
    SELECT ID sensId, make, city
    FROM sensors)
ON readings.sensorId = sensId;
```

Results should look like the data below:

| ID  | ts                          | temp        | sensorId | sensId | make              | city          |
| --- | --------------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | 2019-10-17T00:00:00.000000Z | 19.37373911 | 9160     | 9160   | RS Pro            | Boston        |
| 2   | 2019-10-17T00:00:00.600000Z | 21.91184617 | 9671     | 9671   | United Automation | New York      |
| 3   | 2019-10-17T00:00:01.400000Z | 16.58367834 | 8731     | 8731   | Honeywell         | Miami         |
| 4   | 2019-10-17T00:00:01.500000Z | 16.69308815 | 3447     | 3447   | United Automation | Miami         |
| 5   | 2019-10-17T00:00:01.600000Z | 19.67991569 | 7985     | 7985   | Eberle            | San Francisco |
| 6   | 2019-10-17T00:00:01.600000Z | 15.39514039 | 4230     | 4230   | United Automation | Chicago       |
| 7   | 2019-10-17T00:00:02.100000Z | 15.06719566 | 2829     | 2829   | Honeywell         | New York      |
| ... | ...                         | ...         | ...      | ...    | ...               | ...           |

```questdb-sql title="Aggregation keyed by city"
SELECT city, max(temp)
FROM readings
JOIN(
    SELECT ID sensId, city
    FROM sensors)
ON readings.sensorId = sensId;
```

Results should look like the data below:

| city          | max         |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Boston        | 22.99999233 |
| New York      | 22.99999631 |
| Miami         | 22.99999673 |
| San Francisco | 22.99999531 |
| Chicago       | 22.9999988  |

```questdb-sql title="Aggregation by hourly time buckets"
SELECT ts, city, make, avg(temp)
FROM readings
JOIN (
    SELECT ID sensId, city, make
    FROM sensors
    WHERE city='Miami' AND make='Omron')
ON readings.sensorId = sensId
WHERE ts ='2019-10-21;1d' -- this is an interval between 21-10 and 1day later
SAMPLE BY 1h;
```

Results should look like the data below.

| ts                          | city  | make  | average     |
| --------------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| 2019-10-21T00:00:00.000000Z | Miami | Omron | 18.97225935 |
| 2019-10-21T01:00:00.000000Z | Miami | Omron | 19.15940157 |
| 2019-10-21T02:00:00.000000Z | Miami | Omron | 18.92696357 |
| 2019-10-21T03:00:00.000000Z | Miami | Omron | 19.09917038 |
| 2019-10-21T04:00:00.000000Z | Miami | Omron | 19.1161127  |
| 2019-10-21T05:00:00.000000Z | Miami | Omron | 18.93939597 |
| ...                         | ...   | ...   | ...         |
