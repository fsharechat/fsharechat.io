QuestDB is a relational column-oriented database designed for real-time
analytics on time series and event data. It uses the SQL language with a few
extensions for time series. The below will help you get familiar with QuestDB
and get started.

## Concepts

This section describes the architecture of QuestDB, how it stores and queries
data, and introduces features and capabilities specific to QuestDB.

As a start, we suggest you read about the
[storage model](/docs/concept/storage-model/) and about the
[designated timestamp](/docs/concept/designated-timestamp/). To make the most of
QuestDB, you should also get familiar with our
[SQL extensions](/docs/concept/sql-extensions/) which allow to make the most of
time series capabilities with an efficient non-verbose syntax. You will also
find the [symbol](/docs/concept/symbol/) concept interesting to store and
retrieve repetitive strings efficiently.

## Guides

Setup guides are available for [Docker](/docs/guide/docker/), the
[binaries](/docs/guide/binaries/) or [Homebrew](/docs/guide/homebrew/).

There are guides to get started with the
[Web Console](/docs/guide/web-console/), with the
[Postgres wire protocol (alpha)](/docs/guide/postgres-wire/), the
[REST API](/docs/guide/rest/) or the [Java API](/docs/api/java/).

## Reference

This section contains reference about configuration, functions and SQL language.
