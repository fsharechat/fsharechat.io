There should be many examples describing various situations.

### Basic usage

```questdb-sql title="This example does that"
SELECT a FROM b;
```

### Aggregations

```questdb-sql title="Do something interesting"
SELECT a FROM b;
```

### Joining tables

```questdb-sql title="Something else, equally interesting"
SELECT a FROM b;
```

### With dynamic designated timestamp

```questdb-sql title="This is only interesting for certain users"
SELECT a FROM b;
```
