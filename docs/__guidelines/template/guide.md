How To Guides should have a short description of what they intend to cover. If
your How To has a corresponding section for reference elsewhere in the docs,
make sure to include it here, or in a 'References' section. [References](sql.md)

## First step

Beginning steps. Include any code in code blocks. Make sure that the code is
runnable, and actually works. Each snippet should be executable as one entity -
no several commands into one single snippet.

```shell
/bin/bash -f shell-code-here
```

## Second step

Break things up into sections to make it easy to follow.

:::note

Use Notes to call out important bits of information.
