Writing documentation is hard, some projects tackle that problem in a very
elegant manner. You can find here the list of documentations that we find
greatly architectured, well written and pleasant to use:

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
  (a.k.a. MDN)
- [Shopify](https://shopify.dev/concepts/about-apis/authentication)
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs)

When looking for new ideas, it is recommended to look at those first.
