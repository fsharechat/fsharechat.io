## SQL Editor

### Shortcuts

| Command       | Action                                                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Run query     | `f9` or `ctrl/cmd + enter`                                                  |
| Locate cursor | `f2`, use this to focus the SQL editor on your cursor in order to locate it |

### Behaviour

As you can write numerous SQL commands separated by semicolon, the Web Console
uses the following logic to decide what command to execute:

- Check if you highlighted a query or part of it, if yes then it will be
  executed, otherwise:
- Verify if the cursor is within a SQL statement, if yes, the wrapping statement
  will be executed, otherwise:
- Find out if the cursor is on the same line as a SQL statement and after the
  semicolon, if yes, this statement will be executed, finally:
- If the cursor is on a line that does not contain a SQL statement, the next
  encountered statement will be executed. If there is no statement following the
  cursor, the previous statement will be used.

| `exists`             | You are trying to import a file that already exists. To import it regardless, you can either **append** or **override**. See [importing again](#custom-import) for a more exhaustive description |

### Amending the schema

Although the schema is automatically detected, you can amend the type for any
column using the following steps:

- Click on the file you want to amend in the Import screen. The schema will be
  displayed.
- Find and click on the column which type you want to change.
- You will then need to [re-trigger the import](#custom-import).

### Custom import

You can amend the import behaviour with the following options. This will trigger
to import the data again.

| `A`    | Append                       | Uploaded data will be appended at the end of the table             |
| `O`    | Override                     | Uploaded data will override existing data in the table             |
| `LEV`  | Skip lines with extra values | Skips rows that contains dangling values that don't fit the schema |
