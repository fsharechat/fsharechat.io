Specifies fill behavior for missing data for as part of a
[SAMPLE BY](/docs/reference/sql/sample-by/) aggregation query.

## Syntax

### Options

There are as many `fillOption` as there are `aggreate` columns in your query.

| fillOption | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NONE`     | Will not fill. In case there is no data, the time chunk will be skipped in the results. This means your table could potentially be missing intervals. |
| `NULL`     | Fills with `null`                                                                                                                                     |
| `PREV`     | Fills using the previous value                                                                                                                        |
| `LINEAR`   | Fills by linear interpolation of the 2 surrounding points                                                                                             |
| `x`        | Fills with the constant defined (replace the `x` by the value you want. For example `fill 100.05`                                                     |

## Examples

Consider the following `prices` table

| timestamp | price |
| --------- | ----- |
| ts1       | p1    |
| ts2       | p2    |
| ts3       | p3    |
| ...       | ...   |
| tsn       | pn    |

We could run the following to get the minimum, maximum and average price per
hour using the following query:

```questdb-sql
SELECT timestamp, min(price) min, max(price) max, avg(price) avg
FROM PRICES
SAMPLE BY 1h;
```

It would generally return result like this:

| timestamp | min  | max  | average |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | ------- |
| ts1       | min1 | max1 | avg1    |
| ...       | ...  | ...  | ...     |
| tsn       | minn | maxn | avgn    |

However, in case there was no `PRICES` data for a given hour, your table would
have time chunks missing. In the below example, there is no data to generate
aggregates for `ts3`

| timestamp | min    | max    | average |
| --------- | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| ts1       | min1   | max1   | avg1    |
| ts2       | min2   | max2   | avg2    |
| `ts3`     | `null` | `null` | `null`  |
| ts4       | min4   | max4   | avg4    |
| ...       | ...    | ...    | ...     |
| tsn       | minn   | maxn   | avgn    |

Here you can see that the third time chunk is missing. This is because there was
no price update in the third hour. Let's see what different fill values would
return:

```questdb-sql
SELECT timestamp, min(price) min, max(price) max, avg(price) avg
FROM PRICES
SAMPLE BY 1h
FILL(null, 0, prev);
```

would return the following

| timestamp | min    | max  | average |
| --------- | ------ | ---- | ------- |
| ts1       | min1   | max1 | avg1    |
| ts2       | min2   | max2 | avg2    |
| `ts3`     | `NULL` | `0`  | `avg2`  |
| ts4       | min4   | max4 | avg4    |
| ...       | ...    | ...  | ...     |
| tsn       | minn   | maxn | avgn    |

And the following:

```questdb-sql
SELECT timestamp, min(price) min, avg(price) avg
FROM PRICES
SAMPLE BY 1h
FILL(25.5, linear);
```

Would return:

| timestamp | min    | average         |
| --------- | ------ | --------------- |
| ts1       | min1   | avg1            |
| ts2       | min2   | avg2            |
| `ts3`     | `25.5` | `(avg2+avg4)/2` |
| ts4       | min4   | avg4            |
| ...       | ...    | ...             |
| tsn       | minn   | avgn            |
