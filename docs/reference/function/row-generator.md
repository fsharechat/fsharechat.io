## long_sequence

- `long_sequence(iterations)` - generates rows
- `long_sequence(iterations, seed1, seed2)` - generates rows deterministically

### Arguments

-`iterations`: is a `long` representing the number of rows to generate. -`seed1`
and `seed2` are `long64` representing both parts of a `long128` seed.

### Description

#### Row generation

`long_sequence(iterations)` is used to:

- Generate a number of rows defined by `iterations`.
- Generate a column `x:long` of monotonically increasing long integers starting
  from 1, which can be accessed for queries.

:::tip

You can use this to generate very large datasets for your testing e.g billions
of rows or more if your disk allows.

:::

#### Random number seed

When `long_sequence` is used conjointly with
[random generators](/docs/reference/function/random-value-generator), these
values are usually generated at random. The function supports a seed to be
passed in order to produce deterministic results.

:::tip

Deterministic procedural generation makes it easy to test on vasts amounts of
data without actually moving large files around across machines. Using the same
seed on any machine at any time will consistently produce the same results for
all random functions.

### Examples

```questdb-sql title="Generating multiple rows"
SELECT x, rnd_double()
FROM long_sequence(5);
```

| x   | rnd_double   |
| --- | ------------ |
| 1   | 0.3279246687 |
| 2   | 0.8341038236 |
| 3   | 0.1023834675 |
| 4   | 0.9130602021 |
| 5   | 0.718276777  |

```questdb-sql title="Accessing row_number using the x column"
SELECT x, x*x
FROM long_sequence(5);
```

| x   | x\*x |
| --- | ---- |
| 1   | 1    |
| 2   | 4    |
| 3   | 9    |
| 4   | 16   |
| 5   | 25   |

```questdb-sql title="Using with a seed"
SELECT rnd_double()
FROM long_sequence(2,128349234,4327897);
```

:::note

The results below will be the same on any machine at any time as long as they
use the same seed in long_sequence.
