QuestDB sends telemetry data with information about usage which helps us improve
the product over time. We do not collect any personally-identifying information,
and we do not share any of this data with third parties.

reporting function.

## Disabling telemetry

To disable telemetry, add the following configuration key in
[server.conf](server.md)

```shell title="Disabling telemetry"
telemetry.enabled=false
